             <p>As a proud Pasifika teacher, It makes me happy and glad to see students being proud of where they come from and that is what we want here in ASDAH. Also I really enjoyed the performance and the food the Tuvaluan students prepared for us during lunch at school, it was really delicious, it reminded me of my home-island as well, Fafetai Lasi!</p>
